# Categories Module Implementation (Backend + Frontend)

Date: 2025-09-28

## Backend
- Added CategoryService (app/Services/CategoryService.php) implementing:
  - paginate with filters (search, stock status, min sales/purchases/profit), sorting, eager loads
  - show, store, update, destroy with cache namespace bumping
  - analytics overview per category (products_count, sold_qty, purchased_qty, profit approximations, % of all sold, % of total profit, avg days in stock)
  - topSelling, topPurchased, profitDistribution with caching
- Category model scopes: scopeSearch and scopeStockStatus
- Completed FormRequests: StoreCategoryRequest, UpdateCategoryRequest
- Implemented CategoryController to orchestrate service calls
- Added API routes under /api/categories for CRUD and analytics

## Frontend
- Created services/categories.js with CRUD + analytics and abortable requests
- Added UI components:
  - CategoryList.jsx: paginated table, Apply/Clear filters, sorting, CRUD modal
  - CategoryFormModal.jsx: create/edit with animated transitions
  - CategoryAnalytics.jsx: cards and Recharts charts (top selling, profit distribution)
  - CategoryCard.jsx: small stat card
- Added routes:
  - /dashboard/categories (CategoryList)
  - /dashboard/categories/analytics (CategoryAnalytics)
- Sidebar updates:
  - Added "Categories" link
  - Added "Category Analytics" under Analytics submenu
  - Removed top-level "Settings" from sidebar left

## Notes
- Expensive analytics are cached using CacheHelper namespaces.
- Profit calculations use approximations (qty*price minus cost) for category-level metrics for performance; product-level revenue uses proportional share logic elsewhere.
- UI uses ContentSpinner/SkeletonLoader, memoization hooks, and abort controllers.
