# Reports Module Documentation

## Overview
The Reports module has been completely redesigned with a modern, performance-optimized architecture.

## Structure

### Main Components

1. **ProductsReports.jsx** (Main Component)
   - Ultra-modern UI with glassmorphism effects
   - Complete dashboard for product reports
   - Advanced filtering and date range selection
   - Export to CSV functionality
   - Real-time data refresh
   - 8 KPI cards with animations
   - Responsive design with dark mode support

2. **ProductsReportsCharts.jsx** (Chart Components)
   - `SalesRevenueChart`: Animated area chart for revenue trends
   - `PurchaseTrendsChart`: Interactive line chart for purchases
   - `StockMovementChart`: Composed chart for inventory flow
   - `TopProductsChart`: Bar charts for top products
   - `PerformanceMetricsChart`: Pie chart for inventory distribution
   - `LowStockAlert`: Animated alerts for low stock items

## Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization**: `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- **Callbacks**: `useCallback` for event handlers
- **Abort Controllers**: Request cancellation on unmount
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies

### Interactive Features
- Advanced date range filtering
- Group by day/week/month
- Product-specific filtering
- Low stock threshold adjustment
- Export data to CSV
- Real-time refresh

### Visual Enhancements
- Framer Motion animations
- Gradient color schemes
- Glassmorphism effects
- Custom animated tooltips
- Skeleton loading states
- Hover and interaction effects

## API Integration

Uses the following endpoints from `api/Reports.js`:
- `getSalesReport`: Sales trends and metrics
- `getPurchasesReport`: Purchase trends
- `getStockMovementsReport`: Inventory movements
- `getProductsSold`: Top selling products
- `getProductsPurchased`: Top purchased products
- `getLowStockReport`: Low stock alerts

## Routing

The component is accessible at `/reports` route and replaces the old ReportsDashboard component.

## Key Metrics Displayed

1. **Total Revenue**: Overall sales revenue
2. **Total Profit**: Net profit calculation
3. **Units Sold**: Total quantity sold
4. **Average Order Value**: Mean transaction value
5. **Total Orders**: Number of transactions
6. **Inventory Turnover**: Stock rotation rate
7. **Units Purchased**: Total quantity purchased
8. **Low Stock Items**: Count of items below threshold

## Color Palette

The component uses a carefully designed color system:
- Primary: Blue to Purple gradients
- Success: Green to Emerald gradients
- Warning: Yellow to Orange gradients
- Danger: Red to Rose gradients
- Info: Cyan to Blue gradients

## Cleanup Notes

### Removed Components
- `ReportsDashboard.jsx`: Old reports dashboard (replaced by ProductsReports)

### Updated Files
- `router/Index.jsx`: Updated to use ProductsReports
- `components/SideBar.jsx`: Updated menu links

## Usage

```jsx
import ProductsReports from '@/pages/Reports/ProductsReports';

// The component is self-contained and doesn't require props
<ProductsReports />
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Add more chart types (scatter plots, heat maps)
2. Implement data caching for faster loads
3. Add comparison periods
4. Include predictive analytics
5. Add custom report builder
6. Implement scheduled report generation
7. Add email notifications for low stock

## Maintenance

The component is designed for easy maintenance with:
- Modular chart components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Reusable utility functions
